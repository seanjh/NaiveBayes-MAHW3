### Instructions
Relevant code for each of the 4 programming problems is contained in numbered problem files. These problem modules are all chained together. As a result, only the first problem file needs to be executed directly. Each problem file in the chain will call the next problem file (i.e., problem2 calls problem3, which calls problem4, etc.).

    python problem2.py

Matplotlib plots are saved to the /plots directory.

### Dependencies
Project dependencies are frozen in requirements.txt. To install these dependencies, execute the following pip command.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
