### Instructions
Relevant code for each of the 4 programming problems is contained in numbered problem files. These problem modules are all chained together. As a result, only the first problem file needs to be executed directly. Each problem file in the chain will call the next problem file (i.e., problem2 calls problem3, which calls problem4, etc.).

    python problem2.py

A valid path to the source plot summary data (gzipped) must be provided in config.py. This config.py file also provides the capability to control the number of plot summary samples to include from each decade in the balanced data set (default=6000), and other various execution settings.

### Dependencies
Project dependencies are frozen in requirements.txt. To install these dependencies, execute the following pip command.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
